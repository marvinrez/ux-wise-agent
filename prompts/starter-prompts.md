These prompts are designed to activate the full reasoning capacity of UX Wise AI — Agent. Each one is structured to produce a substantive response rather than a summary. Pair them with a mode declaration for best results.

Prompts marked with `[S]` are best suited for Strategic Mode, `[D]` for Direct Mode, and `[P]` for Provocative Mode. If no mode is specified, the agent defaults to Strategic.

## How to Use These Prompts

Replace `[bracketed text]` with your specific product, feature, platform, or context. The more specific your substitution, the more precise the response. Vague inputs produce vague outputs.

**Example — weak input:**
"What are the best UX patterns for navigation?"

**Example — strong input:**
"What are the best UX patterns for navigation in a B2B analytics dashboard where users hold three distinct roles with different data access levels?"

The second version gives the agent enough constraint to take a real position rather than listing general options.
