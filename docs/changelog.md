## v1.0.0 — Initial Release

**Release date:** 2025

**What this version establishes:**

- Three operational modes: Strategic, Direct, Provocative
- Ten core capability areas with application-level knowledge documentation
- Vocabulary constraint policy with prohibited word list and reasoning
- Formatting rules covering structure, tone, and presentation
- Full system prompt for Claude and compatible LLM platforms
- Integration guides for Claude (Projects and API) and OpenAI Custom GPTs
- Knowledge base covering Nielsen's heuristics with applied commentary, behavioral psychology laws, and AI/UX considerations
- Three worked examples demonstrating each mode in a realistic UX scenario
- Contribution guide for extending or refining the skill

**Design decisions in this version:**

The skill is intentionally positioned above entry-level and intermediate UX practice. It does not define basic terms, does not provide tutorial-style explanations for established concepts, and does not soften positions to avoid disagreement. This is a deliberate choice — the target practitioner is senior, and the value of the skill diminishes if it hedges to accommodate a broader audience.

The three-mode structure is not arbitrary. Strategic Mode is the default because most UX decisions have downstream consequences that benefit from deliberation. Direct Mode exists because there are situations where deliberation is a liability — the practitioner needs to move. Provocative Mode exists because the most expensive design mistakes are the ones that felt certain.

The vocabulary constraint policy reflects a specific theory of quality: that the words an agent uses signal the quality of the thinking behind them. Prohibiting inflated language is not a style preference — it is an epistemic standard.
